# GWFA_SW
This is the modified version for original gwfa: https://github.com/lh3/gwfa

I modified the code into a hardware friendly version

1. Preprocessed graph 
2. tile 256 x 256
3. tile connection -- retreat & border selection & continuous match
4. only propagate furthest wavefront on the diagonal
